    <div class="card"><h2>The Best Moment of Your Life</h2>
    <p>IF SOMEONE WERE to ask us,"Has the best moment of your life arrived yet?" 
        we may say that it will come very soon. But if we continue to live in the same way,
        it may never arrive.We have to transform this moment into the most wonderful moment,
        and we can do that by stopping ---- stopping running to the future,stopping worrying about the past,
        stopping accumulating so much.You are a free person;you are alive.
        Open your eyes and enjoy the sunshine,the beautiful sky ,and the wonderful children all around you.
        Breathing in and out consciously helps you become your best ----
        calm,fresh,solid,clear, and free,able to enjoy the present moment as the best moment of your life.
